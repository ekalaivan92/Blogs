                This is a simple tool to execute C#, F#, VB codes as single Line of
                code / expression, statement(s) or a Program. This is important to me,
                to try to do a simple testing on my understanding while learning or
                experimenting. Let say I am experimenting the JSON merge concepts
                using NewtonSoft.Json, While doing this I might want to do lot of work
                before I am going to do the actual experiment. Example, I have to
                create a Console application / anything using visual studio or any
                other IDE and clean up that project, create required file and etc. But
                with linqPad I can simply write my three line of code and done the
                experiment. It allows us to do lot more thing like create lots of
                classes, or import existing linqpad scripts and use functionality from
                that script, add Nuget packages or refer DLLs, ect.
